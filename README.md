# nodejs-React + Vite chat

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

The app makes use of NodeJs and Express for the server, and ReactJs for the frontend.
It is supported by https://chatengine.io/ api for the messaging part

To run the app on your local machine,
- Open the folder 'NODEJS-REACTJS-CHAT' as root folder on VScode.
- cd to the backend folder to run the server and run the command, 'npm run start'
- Open a new terminal and cd into the frontend folder and run the command, 'npm run dev'
- Open your app through the link that appears.
